Apologies for this being a manual install, but until I get a copy of
the Big Boy's Book of Linux, I won't be able to create an RPM.

For now - you got this text file :-)

Basic setup
-----------

Unzip the contents of this zip file into a new application directory.
Personally, I would use /usr/local/hipster. You will probably need to be
root to create this directory, or use the "sudo" command if you don't have
a root account.

Next, you will need to make the main "hipster" script executable. I would
do this by opening a terminal and typing the following:

cd /usr/local/hipster
chmod 755 hipster

Check the setup
---------------

You can check whether the installation is working by typing:

/usr/local/hipster/hipster

Oh, the humanity! - What to do if it doesn't work
-------------------------------------------------

Assuming you have Java installed, hipster should start up. If it doesn't,
chances are it can't find Java. You will need to go to:

http://www.java.com

unless, by the time you read this, Sun have done the sane and sensible thing
and have open sourced Java and put it in a nice God Fearing repository
that we can all use.

If you are sure you have Java installed, try setting an environment variable
to specify it's location:

JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0 # This is where I have Java
export JAVA_HOME

Then try typing:

/usr/local/hipster/hipster

again. If it doesn't work now, then I've screwed up. Buy a dart board
and put my picture on it.

Hooking it into your X environment
----------------------------------

How you do this, depends upon your desktop environment. You will
need to create some sort of menu shortcut with:

/usr/local/hipster/hipster

as the executable (you may need to add a JAVA_HOME variable to
your GUI's environment script, if you needed that fix above). I put
an icon in:

/usr/local/hipster/chrome/icons

that you might want to use.
