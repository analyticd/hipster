        <h2>Help Topics</h2>
<!-- The more they understand, the less they have to memorize. The 
     only way to reduce the time and pain of the learning curve is 
     to increase learning. Too many manuals mistake reference information 
     and memorization for learning, but we've all experienced the 
     frustration of looking something up, doing it, and then forgetting 
     everything the next time we need to do it again. The only way to 
     really make it "stick" is by helping them 'get it' on a deeper level, 
     where the mental model (thought bubble) in their head matches the one 
     you were trying to communicate... the mental model that lets them 
     extrapolate and infer and be creative about things that weren't in 
     the tutorial.

     While a tutorial is a concrete step-by-step use-case, without a deeper 
     understanding of how and why things work the way they do, the user/learner 
     can have trouble adapting what they did in the tutorial to their own 
     unique use-cases. We've all seen users who end up bending and shoehorning 
     their own work into something that more closely matches what the tutorial 
     did, simply because that's the only way they know how to do it!

     By including a learning and understanding section in the manual, you have 
     the best chance to help users get out of "P mode and--most importantly--want 
     to. This is where you take them from surface users who must call tech support 
     at the first instant anything goes wrong to users who become engaged with the 
     product and enjoy co-discovering all the ways in which the product will help 
     them kick ass.

     It is this part of the manual where the advertising, marketing, and 
     entertainment folks have something to teach us. It is up to us to get the 
     user/learner motivated to not just Open The Manual, but to want to actually... 
     learn new things. Learning new things usually sucks at first, because it 
     means we have to pass through the phase of frustration, confusion, stupidity, 
     anger, etc. Most humans avoid learning anything that comes with a manual, and 
     will try to do as little as possible to get the bare minimum level of competency.

     This won't do if we're actively trying to create and inspire passionate users. 
     We have to make this part of the manual especially enticing, compelling, seductive, 
     entertaining, informative, useful... all without (as many of you warned) making 
     it appear like a shallow sales pitch.

     This is also where it really needs to be memorable. It's amazing how much 
     written documentation is meant to be remembered, but anything BUT memorable. 
     Memory is tied to chemistry, and the brain pays attention and records to 
     long-term memory that which the brain finds important. What your conscious 
     mind wants has nothing to do with it--this is about your legacy brain recognizing 
     that this new thing is useful for long-term survival. And let's face it--most of 
     the content in user manuals are far, far, far, from something the brain thinks 
     is important enough to store.

     So, we have to trick the brain into thinking that [insert widget A into widget B 
     and configure server C...] is just as important (or life-threatening) as the tiger 
     licking his lips outside your cave. And who better to help us make things stand 
     out than advertisers and marketers? Entertainers and graphic designers? Really 
     Good Storytellers? There are a ton of things that can get past the brain's crap 
     filter, but we have to care enough to create a manual that's brain-friendly, not 
     just user-friendly. And the brain is sooooo much pickier about what it attends 
     to and records. -->
