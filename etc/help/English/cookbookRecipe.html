        <h2>Help Topics</h2>
<!-- A tutorial is a specific, concrete example. Reference is, well, reference. 
     Learning and understanding is the place where you start to really "get it" 
     on a deeper level. A Cookbook/Recipe section is where a series of steps that 
     might otherwise live in different places in the manual are all brought together 
     under something like a "How do I..." heading. It's kind of like a playlist; it 
     rarely contains fundamentally new information, and simply groups a collection 
     of otherwise separate pieces into one action/goal-based context.

     For example, the Nikon D200 can do continuous high-speed shooting, but to do it 
     right, you need to change several different settings on the camera including 
     shooting mode, auto-focus, and metering. The problem is, all the different 
     pieces you need are scattered in different places in the manual, and you have 
     to figure out which you need only if you happen to stumble on each section and 
     put the pieces together in your head. A simple, "How do I take high-speed shots?" 
     or even something like, "How do I take action shots?" that described all the 
     things you need to do... in one place... would be a HUGE help.

     If page count is a concern, the cookbook section could simply list the different 
     places in the manual you need to look (e.g. reference page 27, learning page 82, 
     reference page 120, and the last half of the FOO tutorial). And although having 
     to flip pages isn't as user-friendly, it's still way better than leaving it up 
     to chance that the reader will put those pieces together on his own. -->
