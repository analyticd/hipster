        <h2>Help Topics</h2>
<!-- There you are, with the freshly opened box, staring at this huge manual 
     and wondering how long it'll take to just do the One Simple Thing you bought 
     this thing for. A "Start Here" section, which many product manuals include, is 
     a low-intimidation way to help the new user jump in and get something happening. 
     Some early success.

     The problem with many Start Here guides is that they are about configuration 
     and set-up and very little else. There's a Grand Canyon between the Start Here 
     and... the rest of the manual. Ideally, the Start Here would go beyond the 
     initial set-up and function as a kind of mini version of the whole manual. And 
     the Start Here makes a great sales piece for the manual itself. "Hmmmm... the 
     Start Here guide was great, so if the rest of the manual is like that, this 
     shouldn't be too painful. Maybe even fun..."

     Of course we've all seen Start Here guides that were total bait-and-switch--they 
     do indeed look as if they were produced by an inspired and caring design 
     department, but then the REAL manual looks like it was done by someone who really, 
     really doesn't like you.

     One of the best product manual goals we've ever heard is the Electric Rain "User 
     must do something cool in 30 minutes" mission. What would it mean to have a goal 
     like that? Would it change anything about the manual? -->
